CONVENTIONS ADOPTED:
-Each machine has a machine id, which is a positive integer (eventually it could be a generic String).
-Each machine sends data through TCP/IP protocol to this application running on the server.
-Each packet sent contains two integers and a boolean values.
 *The first integer denotes the number of pieces made until now, since the last reset of the counter.
 *The second integer denotes the code(number) of the message that the machine outputs to the GUI.
 *The boolean value denotes the state of the machine: true if it's running and producing regularly, false otherwise.
-The data is sent in this form: 32bit for the first number, 32bit for the second number, 8bit for the boolean value, 
 which is the not of the last bit of this byte.
-Error code is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 43 (because the machines are programmed with that range of errors code).
 *The error 0 of the machine has become the error 43 in the application for avoiding problems.
-Each error code has an associated error description, which is a space separated sequence of strings 
 that reports the error description that matches the error code.
-(?)QR code of the employees is 2 space separated strings: the first denotes the role, the second the number_id.
-Only a single instance of the application is allowed and its made by biding to the server port 9998.
-Mobile stations communicate on the server port 9999.
-(?)Machines communicate on server port that starts from 3000 and goes by the machine_id. 
-The log and the database storage are triggered when one or more of this events happens:
 *A machine goes in state of error (the boolean value received is false).
 *A machine is reset from the GUI.
 *Article in production changes.
 *The tick function executes, event that happens periodically each Launcer.TICK_TIME milliseconds.
-Every time the application is started it checks if there are logs or database entries older that Launcher.DAYSTOKEEP days.
 If this condition is met then those records are deleted from database and log files.
-In error log the value indicating the state of the machine assumes these values:
 * -3, if the application is closed.
 * -2, if there's no connection.
 * -1, if it has been reset.
 * 0, if it is running.
 * 1, if it is in state of error.
-SuiteOne interface is made by mySql: a table named machines contains machine_ids (as primary key)
 and the number of pieces that has made until the last reset in another column that gets updated every TICK_SUITEONE_TIME.
